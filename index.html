            <p>I specialize in UX Research and Design with a strong interest in UI Design. I am passionate about improving the lives of others by first understanding user needs and ideating potential solutions. I enjoy solving unique and complex user problems that requires innovative and outside-of-the-box solutions. 

                I enjoy the ideation phase and brainstorming with a team to come up with a new and fun idea for clients. In a team, I am typically the creative or project lead. 
                
                I am also a life-longer learner and I enjoy learning new things and new ways of accomplishing a task which is why I have enjoyed the UX field. It's always evolving and it challenges you to be more creative with each solution.</p>
